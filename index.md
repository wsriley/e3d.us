Welcome to Eureka 3D

Innovative Software Development

Using the spiral development pattern and accretionary styles since 1982.

Most of our projects have been under tightly locked NDA since 2010, but our work not under NDA such as our clients at Info Reliance, Dreamworks, Atari etc. can be found on my [linked in](https://www.linkedin.com/in/wsriley/) profile or my [resume](http://e3d.us/Resume_Steve_Riley_-_2019.pdf). I host this site and my personal site on Github, as I am a strong proponent of all the technologies they use.

This is primarily a programmer for hire business for Warren Steven Riley Jr.  You can check out his career at [linked in.](http://linkedin.com/in/wsriley) as mentioned previously;)

You can find his resume as a pdf [here](http://e3d.us/Resume_Steve_Riley_-_2019.pdf)

We also broker domain name sales for select clients.  We can help you sell your domain;)
